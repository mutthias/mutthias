ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Matthias, but you can call me Matt! 

I'm a new grad computer science major at the University of California, Davis. I'm currently an IT Specialist at 
Pacific BioLabs with aexperience in full-stack development, as well as an interest in machine learning, AI, and 
data science applications. Outside of school and programming, I partake in a variety of hobbies, such as fitness, 
thrifting, cooking and especially music. I play a variety of instruments, as well as listen to a variety of music 
genres. 

I enjoy combining my hobbies into programming projects, especially those related to music.
