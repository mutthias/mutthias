ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Matthias, but you can call me Matt! 

I'm currently a 3rd year computer science major at the University of California, Davis. I'm an aspiring fullstack developer,
hovever I'm also interested in machine learning, AI, and data science applications. Outside of school and programming, I partake 
in a variety of hobbies, such as playing instruments, fitness, and cooking.
