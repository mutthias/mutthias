ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Matthias, but you can call me Matt! 

I'm a new grad computer science major at the University of California, Davis. I'm currently an IT software engineer with 
experience in full-stack development, as well as an interest in machine learning, AI, and data science applications. 
Outside of school and programming, I partake in a variety of hobbies, such as playing instruments, fitness, thrifting, 
and cooking.

If you found my Github, thank you for taking the time to read!
