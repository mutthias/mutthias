👋 Hi, I’m Matthias, but you can call me Matt!

A few things about me:
  - 📚 I'm currently a 3rd year computer science major at the University of California, Davis. I'm an aspiring fullstack developer,
        hovever I'm also interested in machine learning, AI, and data science!
  - 🎧 Outside of school and programming, I abosolutely love music. I've played piano for about 9 years, and have self-taught
        additional instruments such as bass guitar, electric/acoustic guitar, ukulele, alto sax, and a few smaller ones such
        as the kalimba.
  - 👨‍🍳 Besides music, I really enjoy cooking! Although I'm not Gordon Ramsay, it's so fun trying new recipes and creating
        delicious (or sub-par) food. It's very satisfying seeing the end product of something you created and then fully
        enjoying it after all your hard work.
  - 🏋️‍♀️ Finally, I always allocate time to take care of my fitness by going to the gym and eating clean. A productive and
        efficient mind requires a clean and healthy body.

I have more to present about myself, that I hope to show in the form of my own personal website/portfolio. As of the time this is 
being typed (09/21/2023), I've completed two projects that have deepened my understanding and honed my skills for fullstack development.
I still need to create a portfolio, I've been doing my best to balance working on projects + studying for interviews + working 40 hours
a week + hobbies and a social life (I'm quite busy, some things are a necessity and some for my happiness)!

If you found my Github, thank you for taking the time to read! By reading this you have exceeded the amount of people I intended 
to write this for (zero). Feel free to connect with me at https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthias-gabel/.

Have a wonderful rest of your day!!!!!
